# Software Carpentry assets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swctasks/assets.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/swctasks/assets)

Serving assets (CSS, Javascript, images, and fonts) for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry websites:

*   [Software Carpentry website](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website)
*   [Software Carpentry workshop template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template)
*   [Software Carpentry lesson template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template)
*   [Data Carpentry website](https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry.github.io)

The [Software Carpentry lesson example](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example) and individual lessons can update their assets from the [Software Carpentry lesson template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template) repository, or directly from this repository.

## ./assets/css

Contains the `.scss` files used to generate the `.css` files that are then exported to the websites listed above.

## ./assets/js

All the Javascript.

## ./assets/img

Images that are used across multiple repositories.
Since these are used in both Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry projects,
the names of logos must include 'swc' or 'dc' to distinguish them.
